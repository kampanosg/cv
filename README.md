# CV
This is the "official" repo for my CV. I figured it's a lot easier to keep (and maintain) it here, rather than a random folder in the cloud. There's a compiled PDF for the ~millions of~ recruiters eager to read my CV, but don't know how to compile Latex. 

Otherwise, if you're brave enough, you can compile it from source - just follow the steps listed bellow.

## Building from source

### Requirements
* Editor
* `MacTeX` (https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)

### Building
There's a handy `./build.sh` script that generates a PDF version of the CV.
