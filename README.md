# George Kampanos' CV
This is the "official" repo for my CV. I figured it's a lot easier to keep (and maintain) it under source control, rather than a document in a forgotten drive somewhere in the cloud. The repo contains a compiled PDF for the millions of recruiters that will visit this page, eager to read my CV. Otherwise, if you're brave enough, 

Built with latex because I don't know how to use MS Word.

## Some notes (so I don't forget)

### Requirements
* Editor
* `MacTeX` (https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)

### Building
There's a handy `./build.sh` script that generates a PDF version of the CV.
